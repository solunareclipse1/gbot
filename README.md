# gBot
gBot is a general purpose Discord bot, written in python, designed to be extremely modular and configurable. Just about every default feature of the bot can be changed or disabled, and new ones can be added relatively easily.

## Features
Out of the box, the bot comes with some default commands, for moderation, role management, debug, and a basic music bot. Any and all of these can be disabled by removing their respective files from the cogs folder, and new commands/features can be added by putting .py files in the cogs folder.
